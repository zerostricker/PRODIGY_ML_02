# Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering

## Introduction
This project aims to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's [Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualizing the data
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method

3. Model Implementation
   - Applying K-means clustering

4. Model Evaluation
   - Visualizing clusters
   - Analyzing cluster centers

5. Insights and Recommendations
   - Providing actionable insights based on the clustering results
     
6. Cluster Quality and Evaluation
   - Evaluate the quality of the clusters using the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.



## Results
The K-means algorithm grouped customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
